# Axon Presentation
[Axon](https://axoniq.io/) is open source CQRS and Even Sourcing framework.

In [Trendyol](https://www.trendyol.com/), We have used it for 2 year in the production. We have approximately 15 million wallets that works on it.

We made a presentation about introduction the axon framework and our experiences with it. We hope it will be helpful for people who think use it.
This repo contains presentation and code examples.
